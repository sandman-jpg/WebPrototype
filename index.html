      <p>WIRES currently has 28 branches in NSW dedicated to the rescue and care of native wildlife, with over 2, 500 volunteers. It has received over 150, 000 phone calls in the last financial year, and has helped over 90, 000 animals in that year. WIRES also partners with other oranisations for long-term wildlife conservation projects. WIRES has provided assistance for external wildlife conservation efforts, such as providing funding for wildlife carers, and vets. Additionally, WIRES plays a role in wildlife education, allowing the general public to visit their facilities (Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission). </p>
